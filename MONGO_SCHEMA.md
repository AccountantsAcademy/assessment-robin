### Explanation of Design Choices:

1. **Entities and Relationships**:
  - **User**: Represents the users of the application. Each user has a unique `_id`, an `email`, and a `password`. The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields are used for tracking when the user was created and last updated, respectively.
  - **Post**: Represents the posts created by users. Each post has a unique `_id`, a `title`, and `content`. The `author` field is a foreign key (`FK`) referencing the `User` who created the post, establishing a one-to-many relationship between `User` and `Post`. The `likes` field is an array of `User` IDs, representing the users who have liked the post. Timestamps `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are included for tracking.
  - **Comment**: Represents comments on posts. Each comment has a unique `_id`, `content`, and two foreign keys: `post` (referencing the `Post` it belongs to) and `author` (referencing the `User` who authored the comment). Like `Post`, the `likes` field is an array of `User` IDs. Timestamps `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are also included.

2. **Relationships**:
  - **User-Post (author)**: A one-to-many relationship, where a `User` can author multiple `Post` entities. This relationship supports the application by allowing users to create multiple posts.
  - **User-Post (likes)**: A many-to-many relationship, where multiple `Users` can like multiple `Posts`. This is modeled using an array of `User` IDs in the `likes` field of the `Post` entity. This supports the social interaction functionality of the application.
  - **User-Comment (author)**: A one-to-many relationship, where a `User` can author multiple `Comment` entities. This allows users to engage with posts by commenting.
  - **User-Comment (likes)**: Similar to `Post`, the `Comment` entity also has a many-to-many relationship with `User` through the `likes` field, allowing users to like comments.
  - **Post-Comment**: A one-to-many relationship, where a `Post` can have multiple `Comment` entities associated with it. This relationship supports threading of discussions under each post.

### Support for Application Functionality:
- **Scalability**: The use of foreign keys and arrays for relationships allows the application to easily scale as the number of users, posts, and comments grows. The structure supports efficient querying and indexing strategies to handle large datasets.

- **Performance**: By modeling `likes` as arrays within `Post` and `Comment`, the application can quickly access and update the number of likes without needing complex join operations. This design choice reduces the complexity of database queries, especially in a NoSQL environment like MongoDB.

- **Data Integrity**: The use of foreign keys ensures referential integrity, meaning that posts and comments must be associated with valid users, and comments must be associated with valid posts. This prevents orphaned records and ensures consistent data throughout the application.

- **Flexibility**: The relationships allow users to engage with the content in multiple waysâ€”by creating posts, commenting, and liking both posts and comments. This flexibility supports a rich user experience, encouraging interaction and community building within the application.

This design provides a robust foundation for a social media or content-driven application, ensuring that core functionalities like user interaction, content creation, and engagement are efficiently supported.
